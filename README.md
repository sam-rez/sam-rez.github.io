# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

The site is a **single-page, static portfolio** showcasing my background as a software engineer, including work experience, education, projects, and contact information. It is intentionally lightweight, framework-free, and easy to maintain.
